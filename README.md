This project attempts to take a first step toward addressing the problem of 
food insecurity on college campuses by summarizing the demographic data that 
best predicts a student's food security. This is useful to better target 
solutions to food insecurity to those who most need it. 

There are A LOT of caveats to be had with this data. Most obviously:

- Income is a non-numeric variable, and is self- reported. 
- Variables for race indicate whether a person of that race lives in the household, NOT necessarily the respondent's race
- Demographic data like citizenship likely affects a respondent's probability of responding.
- We'd have preferred to make a distinction between community college and four-year college students, but that wasn't available in the data. Neither was a distinction between public and private colleges.

Data is taken from the US Census Bureau's Current Population Survey Food 
Security Supplement, and both the data and technical documentation are  
available on the [Census Bureau's FTP server.](https://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/ftp/cps_ftp.html#cpssupps)
